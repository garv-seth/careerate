Now, change the way Careerate works, by deleting the old agents functionality (whatever we won’t use anymore) and add on the following, integrating into frontend/backend. Also integrating into the landing page! And changing landing page as needed! Changing each component and even tabs as needed, all while not breaking auth or any other functionality, and keeping looks generally same! Here’s what to add, 1. Build Proprietary Career Models 
	•	Develop a proprietary fine-tuned model specifically trained on deep career data, industry trends, corporate hiring practices, and HR insights.
	•	Not just an LLM: Integrate proprietary career datasets, exclusive job market analytics, and “career graph” knowledge bases that general-purpose models (like GPT-4) don’t inherently have.

2. Solve a Deep, Painful, Specific Problem: “AI Replacement Anxiety”
	•	Explicitly and ruthlessly position Careerate as THE platform explicitly built to combat AI-induced displacement in tech careers.
	•	Offer powerful tools:
	•	AI Vulnerability Audit: Exactly pinpoint jobs vulnerable to automation, quantitatively and specifically for each user.
	•	Career Migration Engine: Provide a unique algorithm to precisely chart paths from declining roles to future-safe roles, including step-by-step re-skilling and transition plans.

3. Advanced Career Simulation (Industry First)
	•	Allow users to simulate their careers in real-time scenarios using AI-generated career “digital twins.” This isn’t just advice—it’s predictive, interactive, and addictive.
	•	Let users “test drive” different career paths virtually before committing. This is a deeply emotional hook that people will pay for.

4. Exclusive, Premium Job Market Data
	•	Aggregate hidden data points like unpublished industry trends, confidential recruiter surveys, layoffs predictions, or early-stage tech disruptions.
	•	Give exclusive, data-backed insights nobody else can.

5. AI-powered Salary Negotiation and Job Contracting
	•	Build an AI negotiation assistant that helps tech professionals significantly boost their salary and perks when changing roles—making your subscription instantly valuable (it literally pays for itself).
given this, delete what we don’t need anymore and integrate fully. Redesigning it!
